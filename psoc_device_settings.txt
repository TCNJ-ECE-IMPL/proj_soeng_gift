LED Array
Interface: SPI, 4 Mbit/sec SPI rate, 16 bits, CPOL=0, CPHA=0
Input Clock: 8 MHz

Notes:
    Writing the entire display requires 32 transfers.  Each one takes 16 bits, hence at least 17 cycles.  Assume 18 cycles.
    In each 16 bit transfer, first 8 bits are "command", the 8 bit value.
    Total 288 bits x 0.250 usec/bit = 72 usec
    


Acrylic LEDs
Interface: SPI, 8 Mbit/sec SPI rate, 10 bits, entire string must be all one transaction!
Input Clock: 48 MHz (internally divided by 6), effective SPI bit rate is 8 MHz
    300 bits of zero, for RESET
    Then 5 x 24 bits = 120 bits
    Total of 420 bits per update
    SPI bit rate 8 Mbits/sec, each SPI bit is a chip
    Chips per payload bit 10
    Payload bit rate = 800 kbits/sec (1.25 usec per payload bit)
    Update time = 420 x 1.25 = 525 usec

    Counter, period = 1088
    24 MHz clock
    Interrupt frequency = 22.059 KHz
    Audio sample rate (ideally 22.050 KHz)
